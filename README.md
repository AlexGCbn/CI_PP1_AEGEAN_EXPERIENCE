# Aegean Experience - HTML & CSS Project

![Website mockup](docs/responsive-website.PNG)

The Aegean Experience is a website that intends to provide users with the appropriate information about the restaurant with the same name, both in text and images. As it is a restaurant's webpage, there was further scope than just the basic intent. The webpage strives to provide visitors with easy to find information, along with visual content that looks appetizing. It is also important to keep the page's style as close to the "sea" or "greek" style as possible, to provide the appropriate feeling to the visitor.
