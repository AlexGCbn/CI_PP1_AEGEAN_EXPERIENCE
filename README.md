# Aegean Experience - HTML & CSS Project

The Aegean Experience is a website that intends to provide users with the appropriate information about the restaurant with the same name, both in text and images. As it is a restaurant's webpage, there was further scope than just the basic intent. The webpage strives to provide visitors with easy to find information, along with visual content that looks appetizing. It is also important to keep the page's style as close to the "sea" or "greek" style as possible, to provide the appropriate feeling to the visitor.

## User Stories:
### As a first time user, I want the page to:
1. Be easy to navigate.
2. Be appropriately themed to Greece and its culture.
3. Have enough information about the food and the place.
4. Have photos that show the food in an appetizing way.

### As a recurring user, I want the page to:
1. Have an easily accessible feedback form.
2. Have up-to-date information.
3. Provide a consistent experience.

### As the website owner, I want the page to:
1. Be responsive.
2. Provide enough information, yet not too much.
3. Be highly accessible.
4. Have a consistent design that sticks to the theme.
