            <h2>Our story:</h2>
            <p>The Aegean Experience was first opened in 2002 by George Papadopoulos in a small corner of the area of
              Monastiraki, Athens. George's vision was to have a restaurant that will have the freshest ingredients
              possible, while also providing the exceptional service that one would get on greek island restaurants,
              right
              in the heart of Athens. Some time after opening the place was brimming with people, as everyone started
              seeing the quality in both food and service.<br>
              A few years after opening, in 2009, George decided that the restaurant's place was not in a busy city like
              Athens, but on the island he had been raised to love all those fresh ingredients, Santorini. Thus, the
              first
              Aegean Experience was closed and the new and updated one opened in the most scenic part of the islan, Oia.

            <h2>Our chef:</h2>
            <p>Our founder, George, is also the head chef. He started cooking at the early age of 16, later following
              culinary studies in France and Italy. He finally settled down in his home country, Greece, where he opened
              the "psarotaverna" (greek for fish taverna) that he always wanted.<br>
              His attention to detail and love for local ingredients has provided our customers with meals to remember
              for
              years now. He has also shown his love for people both at work, leading the kitchen with a healthy
              attitude,
              and in the community by providing food for people in need.</p>

            <h2>The island:</h2>
            <p>There are few words that can describe the beauty of Santorini. Being the only island that seems to have
              been created around a volcano but does not seem connected directly to it on the surface, people have been
              magnetised by it throughout the years. It is one of the most well known greek islands for good
              reasons.<br>
              On Santorini, one can find many places to explore. From beaches covered in black sand to the majestic town
              of "Oia" where watching the sunset is an experience.</p>

            <h2>The ingredients:</h2>
            <p>All our ingredients are hand-picked from the local markets, with very few exceptions that you can always
              ask us about. Since the island provides a big variety of fish and seafood, along with the necessary
              vegetables, our team has decided that there is no better and fresher way to get the ingredients that we
              bring to your plate.<br>
              Are you in the market for some of those ingredients? Ask away and we will not hesitate to direct you to
              our
              suppliers. Not only does it increase the island's economy, it also shows you exactly what you have just
              enjoyed here!</p>
